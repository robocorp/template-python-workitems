# Template: Python - Producer-Consumer

This template leverages the new Python open-source framework [robo](https://github.com/robocorp/robo), and [libraries](https://github.com/robocorp/robo#libraries) from the same project.

It provides the basic structure of a Python project: logging out of the box and controlling your tasks without additional boilerplate. The environment contains the most used libraries, so you do not have to start thinking about those right away. With `robocorp-workitems`, you can just start creating and consuming work items for your process steps.

ðŸ‘‰ After running the bot, check out the `log.html` under the `output` -folder.

This template contains a working robot implementation that has the basic structure where one part produces work items from input and another part that consumes those work items. 

> The [producer-consumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem) model is not limited to two steps, it can continue so that the consumer generates further work items for the next step and so on.

The template tries to keep the amount of functional code at a minimum so you have less to clear out and replace with your own implementation, but some functional logic is needed to have the template working and guiding the key parts.

## Tasks

The robot is split into two tasks, meant to run as separate steps in Control Room. The first task generates (produces) data, and the second one reads (consumes) and processes that data.

### The first task (the producer)

- Load the example Excel file from work item
- Split the Excel file into work items for the consumer

### The second task (the consumer)

> We recommended checking out the article "[Work item exception handling](https://robocorp.com/docs/development-guide/control-room/work-items#work-item-exception-handling)" before diving in.

- Loop through all work items in the queue and access the payloads from the previous step

### Local testing

For best experience to test the work items in this example we recommend using [our VS Code extensions](https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code). With the Robocorp Code extension you can simply run and [select the input work items](https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code/extension-features#using-work-items) to use, create inputs to simulate error cases, and so on.

ðŸš€ Now, you can just get to writing.
